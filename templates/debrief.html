    <h1>Thank you for completing our HIT! You've earned a bonus of <strong id ="total-bonus"></strong>.</h1>
    <p><strong>What was this HIT for?</strong> We are interested in how people work together.
        As you build the widgets, you had a choice to make - you could either <em>follow the protocol</em>, 
        and make a widget in the standard size but risk collecting worse data, or <em>adapt</em> but risk
        making a widget that wouldn't fit with what the other engineers were building. This dilemma is similar
        to one faced by real-world companies and organizations every day.
