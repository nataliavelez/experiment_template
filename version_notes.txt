Use this space to write a narrative description of your experiment, taking care to include
information about (1) motivation, (2) DV and IV, and (3) any changes made to the paradigm,
especially if you pilot multiple versions or are running a multi-experiment study. 

Example: 

> In this game, participants played the role of "aerospace engineers"; their task was to build widgets to 
measure things in space. On each trial, participants were told the _standard size_ of the widget (based 
on company protocol), the _ideal size_ (based on local environment conditions), the _number of engineers_
who had to build connectors for their widget, and the _reception_, or probability of successfully
transmitting messages to the other engineers.

> Participants' score was computed based on two loss functions. The _environment loss_ function measured
the distance between the size of the widget participants built and the ideal size. The _social loss_ 
function measured the distance between the size of the widget participants built and the size of the
connectors made by engineers. This loss function, in turn, was affected by the number of engineers and
the reception. When engineers successfully received a message, they built a connector in exactly the right
size for the participant's widget; otherwise, they built a connector in the standard size. The more
engineers miss the participant's message, the more steeply participants are penalized for moving away
from the standard size. 

> In this iteration of the experiment, we manipulated the _ideal size_ and _number of engineers_, while keeping the 
reception and the standard size fixed. The goal of this particular experiment was to test how
participants adapt their own behavior by balancing environmental and social costs; this experiment provides
an empirical test of the model in [Dessein & Prat (2015)](https://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty/wdessein/papers/attentionnetworks15-04-01.pdf).

> NB: A version with [1,2,3,5,10] engineers was piloted in July 2023. A separate version with [1,3,5,10,15]
engineers was piloted in August 2023. Both used the same experiment code; only scripts/exp-timeline.js (line 302) was edited.
